\--- Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases ---
----------

A new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use a *passphrase* instead of simply a pass*word*. A passphrase consists of a series of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces.

To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.

For example:

* `aa bb cc dd ee` is valid.
* `aa bb cc dd aa` is not valid - the word `aa` appears more than once.
* `aa bb cc dd aaa` is valid - `aa` and `aaa` count as different words.

The system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. *How many passphrases are valid?*
